// useState
// Allows functional components to manage internal state.
// Returns a state variable and a function to update it.
// Commonly used for simple state management, like toggles, counters, and form inputs.


// Handles side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, and DOM manipulations.
// Can replace lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
// Uses a dependency array to control when the effect runs and whether it requires cleanup.


// useContext
// Consumes context values in functional components.
// Helps avoid prop drilling by allowing components to access global or shared state directly.
// Commonly used with Reactâ€™s Context API to manage application-wide states like themes or user authentication.
